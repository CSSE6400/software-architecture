  title: TicketOverflow
  description: |
    An API service that supports ticket purchasing, ticket generation, and seating plan generation for TicketOverflow.

    You must implement the concerts and tickets endpoints.
    
    You must also implement a mock users endpoint as a placeholder while another team develops the users service.
    See the users endpoint for more details on what data to use for mocking.

    Note that the URL used in the cURL examples below are just illustrative, you should replace [http://tickets.api.ticketoverflow.com/api/v1/](http://tickets.api.ticketoverflow.com/api/v1) with the host of your service.

    We have used UUID formatted identifiers in the examples but you may use any style of unique string identifier you wish.

    You should start with the users service, then concerts, and then tickets.

        The health endpoint is useful for determining whether an instance is still healthy.
        This can help if you are configuring auto-scaling groups or load balancers.

        We do not specify the response payload for this endpoint,
        however you may find it useful to return a more detailed status of your system.
        For example: https://eloquentcode.com/rest-api-design-health-check-endpoint

        Each service has a separate health endpoint to allow for flexibility in your implementation.
        __We do not require a separate server for each of the endpoints, i.e. one server can handle requests for all endpoints.__
