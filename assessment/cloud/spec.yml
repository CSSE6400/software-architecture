  description: |
    An API service for scanning malicious emails and providing reports on malicious actors, their targets, and link domains that are used.

    Notes: It is common for users to have email aliases, e.g. example@uq.edu.au could have an alias of example+csse6400@uq.edu.au. For the purposes of this assignment we will treat these as separate email addresses and not the same.


    Updates in v1.1.0:
    - GET /customer/{customer_id}/emails description updated.
    - GET /customer/{customer_id}/emails limit and offset parameters defaults described.

        The health endpoint is useful for determining whether an instance is still healthy.
        This can help if you are configuring auto-scaling groups or load balancers.

        We do not specify the response payload for this endpoint,
        however you may find it useful to return a more detailed status of your system.
        For example: https://eloquentcode.com/rest-api-design-health-check-endpoint

  /customers/{customer_id}/emails:
    get:
      tags:
      - email
      summary: List all submitted emails for a given customer.
      description: |
        Returns a list of all emails submitted for the given customer id with the optional filters applied. The limit and offset parameters are used for stepping through blocks of emails / paging through the results. If the offset is greater than the amount of entries that exist then an empty array should be returned.
        
        If there are no emails associated with the given customer id, an empty array should be returned.

        All other parameters are used to filter the results and should be applied before the limit and offset parameters. e.g. if 300 emails exists and 200 are labelled as malicious then a request of limit=100 and only_malicious=true should return 100 emails. If limit=100, only_malicious=true, and offset=200 then the response should be 0 emails (an empty array).

        <span style="color:red">**The filters are additive and as such if the filter is not in the request then it should not be applied. e.g. if only_malicious=true is not in the request then all emails should be returned regardless of their malicious status. The exception to this is the limit and offset parameters which have defaults which are applied if they are not in the request.**</span>
