<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >Load balancing distributes a load over a set of resources. For example, balancing network traffic across several
servers. Load balancing is crucial to the scalability of modern systems, as often, one physical device cannot
manage the volume of requests or the processing demand (e.g. the large amount network traffic for a large
website).

<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >When load balancing, it is important to ensure that the nodes to which we route requests are able to service the

class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Example 1</span></span>
   Early in my career, I, Evan Hughes, setup a multi-node Directory Server at UQ under the hostname of
<span 
class="ectt-1200">ldap.uq.edu.au</span>. This server was a NoSQL database which implemented the LDAP protocol and supported <span

</p><!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   The service had a load balancer which checked that <span

of the time. However, the health check was too weak. When

class="enumerate-enumitem">the service was still running in memory.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >The health check passed, but in reality, the service was talking to dead nodes, causing upstream services to have
intermittent failures.

 id="x1-6000"></a><span 
class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Example 2</span></span>
   During the rollout of a new prompt for UQ Authenticate, which required users to go to my.UQ to provide
verified contact details &#8211; the Blackboard (learn.uq.edu.au) service went completely offline. The health check for
Blackboard at the time completed a full authentication as a test user to ensure everything was functioning as
expected. Once this user was enrolled into the new rollout, the health checks started reporting failures and within
a matter of minutes the entire pool of nodes were shutdown. This health check was too broad and was not
isolated enough to the service that it was checking.<br 
class="newline" />
</p><!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >A lot of services provide a health check endpoint or a metrics endpoint to help engineers setup a proper level of
health check. We want a health check that is specific enough for the service that it is checking but not so specific
that it is too brittle. For the TaskOverflow application that we are building, a reasonable health check would be that
the health endpoint ensures the database is available and that the application is able to connect to
it.

<!--l. 207--><p class="indent" >   Last week, when we setup the ECS service, we noticed that we could not get an endpoint because the instance
would only be provisioned after our Terraform code had run. This is because ECS is a dynamic scaling service and
it expects a load balancer to route its traffic. To get started we need to create a target group which defines where
traffic can be routed to.

<!--l. 343--><p class="indent" >   This auto scaling policy looks at the average CPU utilization of the service and scales up if it is above 20% and
scales down if it is below 20%. This is a very simple policy but it is a good starting point. We can now deploy our
service and see it scale up and down.
</p><!--l. 352--><p class="indent" >   The next section describes how to send multiple requests to our service to generate traffic to trigger scaling.
This means we need to know the IP address or DNS name of our service. We could look this up in the AWS
console but, in most environments (including the cloud infrastructure assignment), you will want to retrieve this
data automatically. The first Terraform practical described how to output the IP address of an EC2 instance <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xprac-week4">3</a>]</span>.
Similarly, we can output the DNS name of our load balancer.

we will use <span

performs. You will want to be familiar with how load testing works, so that you can test your scalable
implementation.
