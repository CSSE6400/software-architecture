   Early in my career, I, Evan Hughes, setup a multi-node Directory Server at UQ under the hostname of
<span

   During the rollout of a new prompt for UQ Authenticate, which required users to go to my.UQ to provide
verified contact details &#8211; the Blackboard (learn.uq.edu.au) service went completely offline. The health check for
Blackboard at the time completed a full authentication as a test user to ensure everything was functioning as
expected. Once this user was enrolled into the new rollout, the health checks started reporting failures and within
a matter of minutes the entire pool of nodes were shutdown. This health check was too broad and was not
isolated enough to the service that it was checking.
</p><!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   A lot of services will provide a health check endpoint or a metrics endpoint which can help the engineer setup
a proper level of health check. We want a health check that is specific enough for the service that it is checking but
not so specific that it is too brittle. For the TaskOverflow application that we have been building so far, a
reasonable health check would be that the health endpoint ensures the database is available and that the
application is able to connect to it.

<!--l. 201--><p class="indent" >   Last week, when we setup the ECS service, we noticed that we could not get an endpoint because the instance
would only be provisioned after our Terraform code had run. This is because ECS is already a dynamic scaling
service and it expects a load balancer to route its traffic. To get started we need to create a target group which
defines where traffic can be routed to.
