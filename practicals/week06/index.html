   During the rollout of a new prompt for UQ Authenticate, which required users to go to my.UQ to provide
verified contact details &#8211; the Blackboard (learn.uq.edu.au) service went completely offline. The health check for
Blackboard at the time completed a full authentication as a test user to ensure everything was functioning as
expected. Once this user was enrolled into the new rollout, the health checks started reporting failures and within
a matter of minutes the entire pool of nodes were shutdown. This health check was too broad and was not
isolated enough to the service that it was checking.
</p><!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   A lot of services will provide a health check endpoint or a metrics endpoint which can help the engineer setup
a proper level of health check. We want a health check that is specific enough for the service that it is checking but
not so specific that it is too brittle. For the TaskOverflow application that we have been building so far, a
reasonable health check would be that the health endpoint ensures the database is available and that the
application is able to connect to it.

<!--l. 170--><p class="indent" >   To get started, we need to modify how we create our EC2 instances. Instead of manually creating them we are
going to have to tell AWS how to deploy them for us. We can do this by converting our EC2 instance
into a Launch Template. Our launch template is going to look very similar to the instance we had
last week, with a few variables changing. This includes that <span 
class="ectt-1200">user_data </span>must be stored as a base64
encoded string. Some of these changes have been highlighted below. Copy this code into a file called
<span 
class="ectt-1200">ec2.tf</span>.

<!--l. 251--><p class="indent" >   If we deployed this now, we would get one initial instance created for us, due to the <span 
class="ectt-1200">desired_capacity </span>and
<span 
class="ectt-1200">min_size </span>values. Now that we have instances we have the ability for traffic to be routed to them.
Let&#8217;s create a target group which will be on the internal facing side of our load balancer. This is the
side that lets traffic leave the load balancer and hit the instances. Copy this code into a file called
<span

and when to scale down. The policies below are what does this function for us. They listen to the average CPU
usage of the group of instances. If the usage is above 20 percent it will scale up by 1 instance, and if it is below 10
percent it will scale down by 1 instance. We apply a cooldown period so that we do not act too aggressivly
to changes in CPU usage, as instances will take time to start and handle load. Copy this code into

<!--l. 419--><p class="indent" >   Last week, when we setup the ECS service, we noticed that we could not get an endpoint because the instance
would only be provisioned after our Terraform code had run. This is because it is already a dynamic service and it
wants a load balancer to service its traffic. To get started we need to create a target group which is on the
internal side of the load balancer and defines where traffic can be routed to. Copy this code into
