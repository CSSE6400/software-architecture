\section{Goal}
Our goal is to become acquainted with AWS Academy.
You may wish to use AWS if your project requires cloud computing infrastructure.
This document guides you to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enrol in
    \begin{enumerate}[topsep=2pt]
        \item AWS Academy Cloud Foundations [\href{https://awsacademy.instructure.com/courses/147193}{147193}] course;
        \item AWS Academy Cloud Developing [\href{https://awsacademy.instructure.com/courses/147195}{147195}] course;
        \item AWS Academy Learner Lab [\href{https://awsacademy.instructure.com/courses/141930}{141930}] course; and
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Navigate the AWS Academy interface.
    \item Enter the AWS Console from an AWS Academy lab.
    \item Provision an EC2 instance that deploys a simple static website.
\end{itemize}


\section{AWS Academy}
AWS Academy is an educational platform to support teaching AWS services.
In this course, we will be using it in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The AWS Cloud Foundations and AWS Cloud Developing courses are guides to help you to learn how to use AWS.
    \item The AWS Learner Lab provides access to an environment in which you can create AWS infrastructure.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Enrol in AWS Academy}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        Set up your AWS Academy account by responding to your email invitation and clicking \textbf{Get Started}.
        The email invitation will come from AWS Academy.
        Check your junk/spam folders.

        \hspace{20mm}
        \includegraphics[trim=0 45 0 0,clip,width=0.65\textwidth]{images/email-invite}

\end{enumerate}


\section{Exploring the Interface}
\aside{We will just be looking at the Learner Lab today.}

Enter the Learner Lab via the following steps.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Once you have enrolled in the course, you should see the course page.

\includegraphics[trim=0 200 0 0,clip,width=0.95\textwidth]{images/academy-homepage}

\item Navigate to the \texttt{Modules} tab and select the link for ``Launch AWS Academy Learner Lab''.
      You will need to accept the AWS Learner Lab terms and conditions to be able to launch learner lab.
      You may also open and browse the ``AWS Academy Learner Lab Student Guide'' and
      ``Learn how to effectively use the AWS Academy Learner Lab'' links, which cover some of the content of this practical.

\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{images/modules-page}

\item You should now see the Learner Lab interface.
\begin{itemize}
      \item The AWS text, near the top left of the window, with the (currently) red circle is the link to open the AWS console.
      \item You can also see your budget. Note that the budget is not updated in real-time, so avoid creating multiple resources at once.
      \item The \texttt{00:00} is a countdown of hours remaining for your lab.
      A lab can only remain active for 4 hours, after which it will close, unless you press start lab again before the 4 hours expires.
      Once the lab is started, \texttt{00:00} will change to \texttt{04:00}.
      \item AWS details will become important later but are not needed now.
      \item The README button will re-open the text panel currently on the right of the terminal interface.
      \item The README text has a lot of important information including what AWS services are available in the learner labs environment, please read it.
      \item The terminal interface is an environment with the SSH keys required to connect to AWS instances semi-automatically (we will use this today).
\end{itemize}

\hspace{-16mm}
\includegraphics[width=1.05\textwidth]{images/lab-interface}

\notice{If you get an error message saying ``labs.vocareum.com refused to connect.'',
        ensure that your browser is not in the incognito mode.
        If you still encounter this error, try using a different browser.}

\item Go ahead and start the lab. It will take a few moments to get ready.
      The red circle will turn yellow as the lab is starting, and green once it has started.
      Click on the AWS text with the green circle when it is available.
      This will open the AWS Console in a new browser tab.
      (You may need to enable pop-ups from awsacademy.)
      If you end up working for a company which uses AWS, welcome to your new home.

\teacher{It can take much more than a few moments for some students.}

\end{enumerate}

\aside{Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
and Software as a Service (SaaS) provider.
They offer a collection of services which are helpful for development.
For example, they offer virtual compute resources, database storage options, and networking to tie it all together.
Services are offered on a pay as you go model, meaning you only pay for the seconds you use a service.
We will now get acquainted with some simple services offered by AWS.}


\section{AWS EC2}

Today we are going to focus on using AWS's EC2 service.
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is the primary compute service offered by AWS.
It allows you to create virtual machines on Amazon's infrastructure.
You have full control over this machine and can configure it for whatever purpose you need.

Navigate to the search bar in the top left and find the EC2 service.
You might find this interface overwhelming.
It is important to note that since EC2 is one of the primary services offered by AWS,
many smaller services we do not need are bundled into the service.

\teacher{
The Cloud Foundation course has a module (6) that covers EC2 in more depth.
You should direct students to it after completing the Hextris example.
}

\begin{center}
  \noindent
  \includegraphics[trim=0 20 0 0,clip,width=0.95\textwidth]{images/search-ec2}
\end{center}

\noindent
Today, we only need the \texttt{Instances} dashboard.
Navigate to there and select ``Launch instance''.

\begin{center}
  \noindent
  \includegraphics[trim=0 120 0 0,clip,width=0.95\textwidth]{images/ec2-interface}
\end{center}

\subsection{EC2 AMI}
First we need to select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
An AMI is the template that provides instructions on how an instance should be provisioned.
Amazon offers a range of built-in AMIs. There are also community AMIs or you can create your own.
As we just want a simple server today, we will use one of the built-in AMIs.

We will use the Amazon Linux 2023 AMI today,
it is considered one of the fundamental images.
Every AMI has a unique AMI code,
which is \texttt{ami-08b5b3a93ed654d19} for the Amazon Linux 2023 AMI.
%Search for it via the code and select it.

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/launch-instance}

\teacher{This AMI is an instance of Amazon Linux 2 which is a RedHat style distro with yum as its package manager.}

\subsection{Instance Settings}
The settings to configure your instance are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Add a `Name' tag. Call it the name of your website, e.g. \texttt{hextris}.
\item Select an appropriate AMI, i.e. Amazon Linux 2023 AMI, \texttt{ami-053a45fff0a704a47}.
\item Select a 64-bit (x86) architecture.
\item The instance type defines the computing, memory, networking and storage capabilities of your instance. We do not need a large server, choose \texttt{t2.micro}.
\item Select the existing \texttt{vockey} (Type: RSA) key pair option.
\item In network settings, choose `Create security group' and select to allow SSH traffic from anywhere, and HTTPS and HTTP access from the internet.
\item Keep the `Configure storage' settings as default.
\item Do not worry about the `Advanced details' options for now.
\item You can now launch the instance to start your server.
\teacher{To make the box pingable don't forget to add the All-ICMP4 with source anywhere.}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Accessing the Instance}

Return to the \texttt{Instances} dashboard.
You should see that a new instance has been created.
Its instance state might not yet be \texttt{Running}, if not, wait.

\vspace{3mm}
\noindent
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/instance-interface}
\vspace{3mm}

\noindent
Note the public IPv4 address, as we will need to use this to connect to the server.
You will also need this address to test that installation of Hextris in section \ref{sec:installHextris} worked.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Return to the AWS Learner Lab interface.
    \item Run the following, \textcolor{red}{replacing \texttt{127.0.0.1}} with the public IP of your instance.
          This command uses the \texttt{vockey | RSA} key pair to gain SSH access to the machine.
\end{enumerate}
\bash{ssh -i ~/.ssh/labsuser.pem ec2-user@127.0.0.1}

\noindent
For example:
\hspace{5mm}
\vtop{

\vspace{5mm}
\noindent
You can also access the instance by selecting it from the list of instances in the dashboard and clicking the "Connect" button.
This will open a new tab in your browser with terminal access to your instance.


\section{Installing Hextris}\label{sec:installHextris}
Hextris is very simple to install. Using an EC2 interface is perhaps overkill for it.
It is an entirely client-side / static web application which means we just have to serve the static files.

First, we will need to enable serving of static files.
We can install and start the \texttt{httpd} service for this.
The AMI we have picked uses the \texttt{yum} package manager, so to install \texttt{httpd} we run:

\begin{code}[language=bash,numbers=none]{}
> sudo yum install httpd
Last metadata expiration check: ...
Dependencies resolved
..... 
..... 
Total download size: 2.3 M
Installed size: 6.9 M
Is this ok [y/N]:

# enter y to install
..... 
..... 
Complete!
> sudo systemctl enable httpd
Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/httpd.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service.
> sudo systemctl start httpd
\end{code}

All files in the \texttt{/var/www/html} directory will now be served when accessed via \textbf{HTTP}.
Navigate to the public IP address of your EC2 instance in the browser.
You should see an ``It works!'' landing page.

Change to the \texttt{/var/www/html} directory and notice that it is currently empty.
We need to download the static files to this directory so that they can be served.
We can use \texttt{git} for this (though it is not the most suited tool),
but first \texttt{git} needs to be installed on the machine.

\bash{sudo yum install git}

Finally, let's double check we are in the \texttt{/var/www/html} directory.

\bash{cd /var/www/html}

\teacher{
	This path will currently be owned by root, proper permissions can be done (but are not necessary) by following
	\url{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Tutorials.WebServerDB.CreateWebServer.html}
}

And clone the repository into that directory.

\bash{sudo git clone https://github.com/Hextris/hextris .}

\teacher{Mention to not forget about the "." as it is easily missed.}
\teacher{If \texttt{git} is prompting for a username and password then there may be a typo in the repository url.}

Now if you navigate to the \textbf{http} address of the public IP address (e.g. \url{http://18.208.165.253}),
you should be able to see your newly deployed website.
Congratulations!

\notice{
	If you are having timeout issues, one problem could be using \texttt{https} to connect rather than \texttt{http}.
}

\textbf{Make sure you delete your instance when you are finished.}
You have a budget of \$50 USD.
If you exceed your budget, you will be locked out of your Learner Lab.}


\section{Switching to Terraform}

We will now use Terraform to provision the same instance we just created.
\link{Install Terraform}{https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli}, and
also install the Terraform plugin for your IDE.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item First, delete any running instances in your AWS account using the AWS Console.
    \item Next, create a directory on your computer in which to perform these Terraform experiments.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Using Terraform in AWS Learner Labs}
We will redeploy our Hextris application using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
You will need to keep your lab running for the next steps.
(Now is a good time to click start to refresh your 4 hour time limit.)

\newpage
\begin{enumerate}
\item Click on `AWS Details' to display information about the lab.

\hspace{-6mm}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/aws-details}

\item Click on the first `Show' button next to `AWS CLI'. This will display a text block starting with \texttt{[default]}.
\item In your working directory create a file called \texttt{credentials} and copy the contents of the text block into the file.
\textbf{Do \underline{not} share this file contents --- do \underline{not} commit it to any repository}.
Add this file to the \texttt{.gitignore} of any repositories on which you are working.
\item Create a \texttt{main.tf} file in the same directory with the following contents:
\begin{code}[language=terraform,numbers=none]{main.tf}
terraform {
    required_providers {
        aws = {
            source  = "hashicorp/aws"
            version = "~> 5.0"
        }
    }
}

provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-1"
    shared_credentials_files = ["./credentials"]
    default_tags {
        tags = {
            Environment = "Dev"
            Course      = "COMP3880"
            StudentID   = "<Your Student ID>"
        }
  }
}
\end{code}

The \texttt{terraform} block specifies the required external dependencies, here we need to use the AWS provider above version 5.0.
The \texttt{provider} block configures the AWS provider, instructing it which region to use and how to authenticate
(using the \texttt{credentials} file we created).
We also include some \texttt{tags} to add to any resource made by this provider,
these are useful for keeping track of resources in the console.

\item We need to initialise Terraform, which will download the required dependencies.
      This is done with the \texttt{terraform init} command.
\bash{terraform init}

This command will create a \texttt{.terraform} directory which stores providers and a provider lock file, \texttt{.terraform.lock.hcl}.

\item To verify that we have setup Terraform correctly, use \texttt{terraform plan}.
\bash{terraform plan}

As we currently have no resources configured, it should find that no changes are required.
Note that this does not ensure our credentials are correctly configured, as Terraform has no reason to try authenticating yet.

\end{enumerate}


\section{Deploying Hextris}
First, we will need to create an EC2 instance resource.
The AWS provider calls this resource an \link{\texttt{aws\_instance}}{https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/instance}.
Get familiar with the documentation page.
Most Terraform providers have reasonable documentation.
Reading the argument reference section helps to understand what a resource is capable of doing.

We will start off with the basic information for the resource.
Configure it to use a specific Amazon Machine Instance (AMI), and chose the \texttt{t2.micro} size.
We will also give it a name so that it is easy to find.
Add the following basic \texttt{resource} block to \texttt{main.tf}:

\begin{code}[language=terraform,numbers=none]{main.tf}
resource "aws_instance" "hextris-server" {
    ami           = "ami-08b5b3a93ed654d19"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    key_name      = "vockey"
    
    tags = {
        Name = "hextris"
    }
}      
\end{code}

To create the server, invoke \texttt{terraform apply},
which will first do \texttt{terraform plan} and prompt us to confirm if we want to apply the changes.

\bash{terraform apply}

You should be prompted with something similar to the output below.

\begin{code}[numbers=none]{}
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_instance.hextris-server will be created
  + resource "aws_instance" "hextris-server" {
      + ami                                  = "ami-08b5b3a93ed654d19"
      (omitted)
      + instance_type                        = "t2.micro"
      (omitted)
      + tags                                 = {
          + "Name" = "hextris"
        }
      (omitted)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: 
\end{code}

If the plan looks sensible enter \texttt{yes} to enact the changes.

\begin{code}[numbers=none]{}
  Enter a value: yes

aws_instance.hextris-server: Creating...
aws_instance.hextris-server: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
aws_instance.hextris-server: Still creating... [20s elapsed]
aws_instance.hextris-server: Still creating... [30s elapsed]
aws_instance.hextris-server: Still creating... [40s elapsed]
aws_instance.hextris-server: Creation complete after 47s [id=i-08c92a097ae7c5b18]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
\end{code}

You can now check in the AWS Console that an EC2 instance with the name \texttt{hextris} has been created.
Now that we have a server, we should try to configure it to serve Hextris.
We will use the \texttt{user\_data} field, which configures commands to run when launching the instance.
First we need a script to provision the server, if we combine all our commands from section \ref{sec:installHextris}, we will produce this script:

\begin{code}[language=bash,numbers=none]{serve-hextris.sh}
#!/bin/bash
yum install -y httpd
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd

yum install -y git
cd /var/www/html
git clone https://github.com/Hextris/hextris .  
\end{code}

\teacher{The hash bang is required.}

\teacher{Don't forget the \texttt{-y} on \texttt{yum install}.}

Now we can add the following field to our Terraform resource.
It uses the Terraform \texttt{file} function to load the contents of a file named \texttt{serve-hextris.sh},
relative to the Terraform directory.
The contents of that file is passed to the \texttt{user\_data} field.

\begin{code}[language=terraform,numbers=none]{}
user_data = file("./serve-hextris.sh")
\end{code}

If you run the \texttt{terraform plan} command now,
you will notice that Terraform has identified that this change will require creating a new EC2 instance.
Where possible, Terraform will try to update a resource in-place
but since this changes how an instance is started, it needs to be replaced.
Go ahead and apply the changes.

Now, in theory, we should have deployed Hextris to an EC2 instance.
But how do we access that instance?
We \textit{could} go to the AWS Console and find the public IP address.
However, it turns out that Terraform already knows the public IP address.
In fact, if you open the Terraform state file (\texttt{terraform.tfstate}),
you should be able to find it hidden away in there.
But, we do not want to go hunting through this file all the time.
Instead we will use the \texttt{output} keyword.

We can specify certain attributes as `output' attributes.
Output attributes are printed to the terminal when the module is invoked directly.
They can also be used by other Terraform configuration files.

\begin{code}[language=terraform,numbers=none]{main.tf}
output "hextris-url" {
  value = aws_instance.hextris-server.public_ip
}
\end{code}

This creates a new output attribute, \texttt{hextris-url},
which references the \texttt{public\_ip} attribute of our \texttt{hextris-server} resource.
Note that resources in Terraform are addressed by the resource type (\texttt{aws\_instance})
followed by the name of the resource (\texttt{hextris-server}).

If you \texttt{apply} the changes, it should tell you the public IP address of the instance resource.
\bash{terraform apply}

\begin{code}[numbers=none]{}
aws_instance.hextris-server: Refreshing state... [id=i-043a61ff86aa272e0]

Outputs:
hextris-url = "3.82.225.65"
\end{code}

You can apply this plan to save these new output values to the Terraform state, without changing any real infrastructure.  

So let's try and access that URL, hmm.
That is strange. Something has gone wrong.


\section{Security Groups}
When we setup our EC2 instance using the AWS Console,
it helpfully created a new security group for us.
We specified that this security group should allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic by allowing traffic from ports 22, 80, and 443 respectively.
When configuring with Terraform, security groups and their attachment to EC2 instances are separate resources.
Refer back to the Terraform documentation for details or,
as is normally quicker, \href{https://www.google.com/search?q=terraform+aws+security+group}{Google ``terraform aws security group''}.

First, let us create an appropriate security group.
Recall that in the AWS Console configuration,
ingress SSH access (port 22) and all egress%
\footnote{Ingress and egress in networking just means incoming and outgoing respectively.}
traffic were automatically configured and we just added ingress port 80.
In Terraform the whole state must be configured so we specify two \texttt{ingress} blocks,
one for HTTP (port 80) and one for SSH access (port 22).%
\footnote{We do not actually need SSH access as all the server configuration is done when the machine is provisioned,
thanks to the \texttt{user\_data},
but we are trying to create a new instance that is identical to the original AWS Console in section \ref{sec:installHextris}.}
Additionally, we will create egress for all outgoing traffic.

\begin{code}[language=terraform,numbers=none]{}
resource "aws_security_group" "hextris-server" {
  name = "hextris-server"
  description = "Hextris HTTP and SSH access"

  ingress {
    from_port = 80
    to_port = 80
    protocol = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    from_port = 22
    to_port = 22
    protocol = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port = 0
    to_port = 0
    protocol = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
\end{code}

Note the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{from\_port} and \texttt{to\_port} are the start and end of a range of ports rather than incoming or outgoing.
        In this example our range is 80-80.
  \item \texttt{protocol} set to ``-1'' is a special flag to indicate all protocols.
  \item Explaining \texttt{cidr} is outside the scope of the course, but the specified block above means to apply to all IP addresses.
\end{itemize}

You may now \texttt{apply} the changes to create this new security group resource.

Next, we will attach the security group to the EC2 instance.
Return to the \texttt{aws\_instance.hextrix-server} resource
and include the following line:

\begin{code}[language=terraform,numbers=none]{}
security_groups = [aws_security_group.hextris-server.name]
\end{code}

Note that EC2 instances can have multiple security groups.
Once again notice the structure of resource identifiers in AWS.

% Now if we try to apply or plan these changes,
% we will notice that the change of security group forces replacement.
% TODO: I don't actually know why it does this.

Now \texttt{apply} the changes.
If you now try to access via the IP address
(the IP address may have changed),
you should be able to view the Hextris website.


\section{Tearing Down}

One of the important features of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is all the configuration we just did is stored in a file.
This file can, and should be, version controlled and subject to the same quality rules of code files.
It also means that if we want to redeploy Hextris at any point,
we can easily just run the IaC to deploy it.

To try this out, let us first take everything down.
We can do this with:
\bash{terraform destroy}

You should be prompted to confirm that you want to destroy all of the resources in the state.
Once Terraform has finished taking everything down,
confirm that you can no longer access the website and that the AWS console says the instances have been destroyed.

Now go ahead and apply the changes to bring everything back:
\bash{terraform apply}

Confirm that this brings the website back exactly as before (with a different IP address).
You can now start any project you want and almost instantly spin back up the infrastructure you have configured.
That is the beauty of Infrastructure as Code!

\textbf{Hint:} Destroy everything again before you finish.


\section{Querying for Latest AMI}

As this documentation is by necessity written before you attempt the exercises,
sometimes the AMI that we were using is out of date or does not exist any more.
We could instead query AWS for the latest AMI and use that in our Terraform.

To do this we introduce a new data source, \texttt{aws\_ami}.
Data sources fetch or query data from the provider, rather than creating something.

Add the following to your \texttt{main.tf} file:

\begin{code}[language=terraform,numbers=none]{}
data "aws_ami" "latest" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["amazon"]

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["al2023-ami-2023*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "root-device-type"
    values = ["ebs"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "architecture"
    values = ["x86_64"]
  }
}
\end{code}

The \texttt{aws\_ami} data source will find the latest Amazon Linux 2023 AMI for 64 bit x86, which is what is running on our EC2 instance.

To use the data source we need to change the \texttt{ami} attribute of the \texttt{aws\_instance} resource to use the data source. This is done as so:

\begin{code}[language=terraform,numbers=none]{}
resource "aws_instance" "hextris-server" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.latest.id
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "vockey"
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.hextris-server.name]
  user_data = file("./serve-hextris.sh")

  tags = {
    Name = "hextris"
  }
}
\end{code}

And now, if you run \texttt{terraform plan}, you may see that it wants to destroy and recreate the EC2 instance.
This will be because the AMI has changed since this documentation was last updated.

\section{AWS Networking Terminology}
\paragraph{AWS Regions}
Regions are the physical locations of AWS data centres.
When applying Terraform, the changes are made to one region at a time.
In our case we specified the region \texttt{us-east-1}.
Often you do not need to deploy to more than one region, however,
it can help decrease latency and reduce risk from a major disaster.
Generally, pick a region and stick with it.
We have picked \texttt{us-east-1} because it is the least expensive.

\paragraph{Availability Zones}
An AWS Region will consist of availability zones, normally named with letters.
For example, the AWS Region located in Sydney, \texttt{ap-southeast-2} has three availability zones:
\texttt{ap-southeast-2a}, \texttt{ap-southeast-2b}, and \texttt{ap-southeast-2c}.
An availability zone is a collection of resources which run on separate power supplies and networks.
Essentially minimising the risk that multiple availability zones would fail at once.

\paragraph{VPC}
Virtual Private Clouds, or VPCs,
are virtual networks under your control,
if you have managed a regular network before it should be familiar.
VPCs are contained within one region but are spread across multiple availability zones.
