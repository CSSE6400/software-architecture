 id="x1-2000"></a><span 
class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Task</span></span>
   You are working for SpamOverflow, a new competitor in the email security space. SpamOverflow uses a
microservices based architecture to implement their new malicious email filtering platform. The CEO saw on your
resume that you are taking Software Architecture and has assigned you to design and implement a service. This
service must be scalable to cope with a large influx of emails.
   
</p>
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a><span 
class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Requirements</span></span>
   Email filtering software can filter email as it arrives or after. SpamOverflow will implement a service
that does not impede the flow of traffic (i.e. does not prevent email from arriving). It will receive
an API call when the mail server receives an email message. The service then pulls the email from
the user&#8217;s inbox, as fast as it can, to prevent the user from seeing the malicious email or clicking any
links.
</p><!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   Commercial email providers send an API request for each email received. For optimal performance this service
needs to be able to handle a large number of requests in a short period of time.
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    
</p><!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   Since these emails can be dangerous, the service must be able to report that it is bad or good in a timely
manner. Though genuine emails that are incorrectly marked as dangerous should be returned to the user as
quickly as possible.
</p><!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   Persistence is an important characteristic of the platform. Customers will want to analyse why emails were
flagged after the fact. Upon receiving an email scan request, and after filtering, the system must guarantee that
the data has been saved to persistent storage before returning a success response.

   The Department of Defence (DoD) has adopted SpamOverflow. They are a high value customer and you must
ensure that their requests are handled quickly. All other customers have a service level agreement (SLA) that
guarantees a certain level of responsiveness. You cannot ignore their requests to only prioritise the DoD&#8217;s
requests.

   A bad actor has managed to get the email addresses of all employees of &#x003C;Large Company&#x003E;. They have sent a
phishing email to all of the users advertising a pay raise with a link to a fake login page. The email is sent to all
10,000 employees at the same time.

   A bad actor has trained an AI model using social media profiles of targeted victims. They can generate
personalised phishing email messages based on personal information. As the messages are personalised,
they can be of greatly different lengths and contain different content. These messages can only be
identified by SpamHammer. They have sent these phishing messages to 2,000 users at the same
time.
