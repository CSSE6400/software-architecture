<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >Text-to-speech software supports accessibility, enables smart-home devices, and even breaks down
language barriers. Unfortunately, text-to-speech is computationally intensive. While the technology
has made great advances over the past few decades, many open-source implementations are still
inefficient.
</p><!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   The University of Queensland is looking to convert all course content into speech. This will support visually
impaired students in their studies. All course content from Ed discussion forum posts and blackboard
announcements to textbooks must be converted to speech. You are responsible for designing and implementing
a service to generate synthesized speech for use across the entire university.

<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >As you might imagine, blackboard announcements occur frequently and should be translated in almost
real time. While textbooks are set ahead of semester and may take several days to process. The
university will experience peaks of usage. At the start of semester, instructors set many textbooks
which need to be processed. The university will also experience usage lows over the summer holiday
period when few translations will be required. The university is not willing to pay for the resources
required during usage peaks all year round. Your implementation must be able to scale dynamically
based on the current amount of jobs to be processed. Your implementation must use AWS cloud
resources.
</p><!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   Your implementation must implement the following API specification:<br

class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Semester break</span></span>
   Your application will see decreased usage during the semester break. Minimal students and staff may
periodically query pre-generated speech when revising content. During this period we might see traffic of not
more than 20 parallel users, querying read-only endpoints.

class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Exam revision</span></span>
   During the 20 minutes prior to an exam of a large course, such as CSSE1001, you might expect the entire
cohort of over one thousand students to be revising the content. Revising the content will consist primarily of
read-only requests.
</p>
<!--l. 98--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-11000"></a><span 
class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Monday of exam block</span></span>
   Courses with large enrolments tend to have their exam scheduled at the start of exam block. This gives course
staff the most possible time to mark these exam papers. At 8am on Monday of exam block, the 4 largest cohorts
will begin using your service for revision.
</p><!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >   In addition, teaching staff for exams later in the week have begun uploading revision material. We might
expect about 30 staff members to upload their one page course summaries, about 3,500 characters
each.
</p>
<!--l. 108--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-12000"></a><span 
class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Teaching cancelled</span></span>
   Queensland has seen &#8216;unprecedented&#8217; rainfall causing the university to flood. The university admin have made
the call to cancel teaching for the week. Coordinators are responsible for disseminating this information to their
students. All 1,957 courses must send announcements averaging 100 characters (many exact copies of the
suggested announcement), to relay this information.
</p>
<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-13000"></a><span 
class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Reading list due date</span></span>
   The library has a deadline for course coordinators to submit their course reading lists. In this completely
fictional example, we can imagine that coordinators have left uploading their reading list until the last minute.
Suddenly your system receives a large amount of requests to generate the spoken version of textbooks (we
estimate that textbooks are around 350,000 characters). About 100 coordinators submit their reading list at the
last minute.
</p>
<!--l. 122--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-14000"></a><span 
class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">In-semester Monday morning</span></span>
   Each semester there are a small number of new courses running for the first time. These courses,
in an attempt to keep up with the passage of time, upload the course material for the week on a
Monday morning. About 20 courses uploading 15,000 characters of material. At the same time,
many coordinators like to send out announcements on Monday mornings summarising the week&#8217;s
content. These announcements are typically around 150 characters long and sent out by 75 or so
coordinators.
