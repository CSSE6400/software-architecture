<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >Following the overwhelming success of online learning, the University of Queensland is seeking to expand its
online course catalogue. To do so, they are deploying the online Learning Management System (LMS), yLearn, an
alternative to Blackboard written from the ground up. You are leading the team at UQ&#8217;s Information Technology
Services (ITS) to design this system.
</p><!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >   Blackboard utilised a monolithic architecture. This quickly became a problem as the system grew in size and
complexity. The system was difficult to maintain and nearly impossible extend. ITS is looking to
avoid this problem going forward by developing a distributed system that more naturally fits the
small team structure while maintaining core shared data. This will allow the team to maintain the
functionality under their care, and eventually, extend the system with new features such as online
examinations.

discuss the pros and cons of various design options.

UQ&#8217;s Single Sign-On (SSO) uses SAML authentication, how would you integrate with this protocol? If UQ
wanted to enable self-managed account creation and course enrolment, how would you integrate with
that?

<!--l. 98--><p class="noindent" >With a distributed system, there is always a risk of server failure or other system errors. How can you design the
system to be fault-tolerant and recover from failures quickly and efficiently? Are their particular components of
your system that would necessitate services to fail? Could you remove that dependency? What would you be
trading off?

 id="x1-10000"></a>Challenge 3: Ad-hoc Tooling</h4>
<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >Often academics write their own tooling to help operate courses. Ideally, these academics would not place
additional burden on ITS staff by making requests to integrate their own tool with the LMS system. How would
you design a system that allows academics to deploy their own tools based on the permission they already have
for their course? How would this system avoid having to require ITS involvement? How would this system
preserve user data security?
