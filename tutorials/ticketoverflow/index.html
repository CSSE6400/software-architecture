<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >Recent controversy has brought attention to the monopoly held by certain ticketing companies. In hopes of an
eventual collapse of the current monopoly, we aim to develop TicketOverflow, an online concert ticket booking
system.
</p>
<!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a><span 
class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Task</span></span>
   You are working for TicketOverflow, a new competitor in the online ticket booking space. TicketOverflow uses a
microservices based architecture to implement their new platform. The CEO saw on your resume that you took
Software Architecture and has assigned you to design and implement the ticket purchasing service. This service
must be scalable to cope with a large influx of bookings.
</p><!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   You also need to implement a mock of the users service. This service is being implemented by another team at
TicketOverflow. You need to implement a mock to allow your ticket purchasing service to be tested. Your mock of
this service will use a hard-coded list of users.
</p>
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a><span 
class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Requirements</span></span>
   As you may be aware, ticket booking platforms have intense peaks of traffic. At the scale that TicketOverflow
hopes to operate, it would be inappropriate to run the servers required to meet demand at all times. Thus,
our service must be elastic &#8212; able to scale up to meet demand and able to scale down to preserve
costs.

class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Small concert</span></span>
   As TicketOverflow is starting out, it will need to scale to the size of a small concert. Playhouse at QPAC is one
of the first venues to sign up for the service. Their customers purchase tickets in advance over a longer period of
time.
</p>
<!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-11000"></a><span

   Hamilton is now showing at the Lyric Theatre at QPAC and the pre-sale tickets are released for a limited time.
The tickets are in high demand, and there are a large number of customers trying to purchase tickets at the same
time.

 id="x1-12000"></a><span 
class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">General sale for Hamilton</span></span>
   The general sale for Hamilton has started, and there is a surge of customers trying to purchase
tickets at the same time. This leads to a high traffic volume on the website, which puts a strain on
TicketOverflow.
</p>
<!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-13000"></a><span 
class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Seating plan launch</span></span>
   The frontend team at TicketOverflow have developed a new ticket purchasing interface that shows users the
seating plan before they purchase. A large concert is being used to trial this new feature. You need to ensure
that the rendering of the seating plan does not interfere with the high volume of associated ticket
purchases.
</p>
<!--l. 100--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-14000"></a><span 
class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Evening shows at QPAC</span></span>
   All QPAC venues are now supported in TicketOverflow. Each evening there are multiple concerts that run
concurrently. TicketOverflow must be able to handle a steady stream of parallel purchases, ticket generation, and
seating plan generation.
</p>
<!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-15000"></a><span 
class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Priority tickets</span></span>
   Tickets recently went on sale for a large concert in four months time. Some of the ticket purchasers are
downloading their tickets in advance. Meanwhile an evening show for a smaller concert is starting in a few
minutes. The evening show attendees should be able to download their tickets without being impacted by the
later concert.
</p>

class="Cabin-Bold-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Copyright infringement</span></span>
   Due to a copyright notice, &#8220;Elsa on Ice&#8221;, has to be renamed to &#8220;Bob on Ice&#8221;. Unfortunately, this is a last minute
name change while many users are logging in to generate their tickets. Your system must ensure that they are not
shown incorrect tickets and gracefully handles re-generation of tickets.
</p><!--l. 116--><p class="indent" >   You are not required to queue up re-printing all the tickets that have already been printed.
As indicated in the API specification for the update concert endpoint (<a

 id="x1-16001f1"></a>),
&#8220;any existing tickets that have been generated need to be removed.&#8221; This means that, for the concert which is
updated, all tickets that have a <span 
class="ectt-1200">PRINTED </span>status must have that status changed to <span 
class="ectt-1200">NOT_PRINTED</span>. You need to
ensure that tickets with a <span 
class="ectt-1200">PENDING </span>status cannot print tickets with outdated information. It is the client&#8217;s
responsibility to determine that the ticket status has changed and to re-print the ticket. Your system has to
manage the load.

   Taylor Swift has chosen TicketOverflow for the release of her Eras Tour. It is estimated that there will be about
2.8 million purchases during this time. Your service should do its best to remain responsive during the launch of
the tour.
