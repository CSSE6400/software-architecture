<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" >An introduction to Software Architecture would be incomplete without the requisite exploration
into the term &#8216;software architecture&#8217;. The term is often overloaded to describe a number of
completely separate concepts. The overloaded nature of the term makes an introduction
quite challenging. Martin Fowler wrestles with this difficultly in his talk on <a

<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >We assume that as software engineers you wish to deliver high quality software systems. What makes life
interesting<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn2x0" id="fn2x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a

is that <span 
class="Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1-x-x-120">quality</span>, like <span 
class="Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1-x-x-120">beauty</span>, is in the eye of the beholder. As a diligent and enthusiastic software engineer, you may
think that <span 
class="Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1-x-x-120">high quality </span>means well designed software with few defects. On the other hand, your users may think
that <span 
class="Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1-x-x-120">high quality </span>means an engaging user experience, with no defects. While your project sponsor, who is
funding the project, may think that <span 
class="Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1-x-x-120">high quality </span>means the software includes all the features they
requested and was delivered on-time and on-budget. Rarely is there enough time and money available
to deliver everything to the highest standard. The development team has to balance competing
expectations and priorities to develop a software system that is a good compromise and meets its key
goals.
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    
</p><!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   From the perspective of designing a software architecture, competing expectations provides what are
sometimes called <span 
class="Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1-x-x-120">architectural drivers</span>.
</p><!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30002.1"></a>Functional Requirements</h4>
<!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >A seemingly obvious driver is the functional requirements for the software system, i.e. what the software should
do. If you do not know what the software is meant to do, how can you design it? You do not need an extensive
and in-depth description of every small feature of the software, but you do need to know what problem the
software is meant to solve, who are the key users, and what are the key features of the software. Without this
information, you do not know what style of architecture is going to be appropriate for the software
system.
</p><!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >   For example, consider an application that allows users to write and save notes with embedded images and
videos. Say the decision was made to implement it as a simple mobile app that saves notes locally. If it is then
decided that web and desktop applications are needed, allowing users to sync their notes across applications and
share notes with others, the application will need to be redesigned from scratch. Knowing up-front that the
software needed to support multiple platforms, and that syncing and sharing notes was important,
would have allowed the developers to design a software architecture that would support this from the
start.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn3x0" id="fn3x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-3001f3"></a>

</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-40002.2"></a>Constraints</h4>
<!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >Constraints are external factors that are imposed on the development project. Commonly, these are imposed by
the organisation for whom you are building the software system. The most obvious constraint is time and budget.
A sophisticated software architecture will take more time, and consume more of the total budget, than a simple
but less flexible architecture.
</p><!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   Other common constraints are technology, people, and the organisation&#8217;s environment. Technology constraints
are one of the most common set of constraints that affect the design of the architecture. Even if it is a &#8220;greenfields&#8221;
project<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn4x0" id="fn4x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-4001f4"></a>
there will usually be restrictions on choices of technology that may or may not be used. For example, if all of the
organisation&#8217;s existing applications are running on the Google cloud platform, there will probably be a restriction
requiring all new applications to be built on the same platform to avoid the overheads of working with different
cloud providers.
</p><!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   People constraints takes into consideration the skills that are available within the organisation
and the availability of developers for the project. Designing an architecture that requires skills that
are not available, adds risk to project success and overhead to the project&#8217;s development cost. If
contractors can be hired, or training is available, these may reduce some of the risks, but there will still be
budget overhead. The decision needs to be made based on the risks, budget available, and potential
benefits.
</p><!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   The organisation&#8217;s environment may influence other constraints, or add new constraints. An organisation that
encourages innovation may be flexible in allowing some technology constraints to be broken. If the project is of
strategic value to the business, there may be options to negotiate for a larger budget or to adopt a new
technology<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn5x0" id="fn5x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">5</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-4003f5"></a>,
if they could lead to a more robust solution with a longer lifespan. Politics can introduce constraints on
architectural choices. If there is an influential group who promote a particular architectural style, it may be difficult
or impossible to make different choices.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-50002.3"></a>Principles</h4>
<!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >Principles are self-imposed approaches to designing the software. Typically these are standards that all developers
are expected to follow to try to ensure the overall software design is consistent. From a programming perspective,
coding standards and test coverage goals are examples of principles that all developers are expected to follow.
Architectural principles typically relate to how the software should be structured and how design decisions should
be made to work well with the software architecture. Consequently, principles usually do not influence the
architecture<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn6x0" id="fn6x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">6</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-5001f6"></a>,
rather the architecture will influence which principles should be prioritised during software design.
</p><!--l. 97--><p class="indent" >   As an example, if the software architecture is designed to be scalable to accommodate peaks in load, then an
architectural principle might be that software components should be stateless to allow them to be easily
replicated to share the load. Another principle might be that an architecture that relies on an underlying object
model, will adopt the SOLID design principles <span class="cite">[<a

properties required for the project to be successful. These non-functional requirements are also termed <span

architecture designed to support them. Likewise, software architecture quality and consistency is achieved by

The extent and format of the documentation will depend on the size of the project, team organisation, and the
software engineering process being followed. The larger the team, or if the team is distributed between different
locations, the more important it is that the documentation is well-defined and easily accessible. The
documentation may be stored as notes in a wiki or as a collection of user stories and other notes. Or, it could be
an extensive set of requirements and design specifications following a standard like <a

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4    </span> <a 
 id="x1-90004"></a>The World Today</h3>
<!--l. 168--><p class="noindent" >Software architecture today is more important than ever. The importance of architecture can be considered a
result of <span 
class="Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1-x-x-120">expectations </span>and <span 
class="Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1-x-x-120">infrastructure</span>. Today we expect our software to be available 24/7. To exemplify this point,
in October 2021 Facebook went offline for 6-7 hours out of the 8760 hours of the year. Those 6-7 hours of
downtime resulted in mass media coverage, $60 million loss of revenue, and a 5% drop in company shares which
caused Zuckerberg&#8217;s wealth alone to drop $6 billion. Interestingly, the outage also caused other sites such as
Gmail, TikTok, and Snapchat to slowdown.
</p><!--l. 176--><p class="indent" >   This is a massive change in public expectations for software availability. As recently as 2017, human resources
at UQ would monopolise the university&#8217;s computing resources for an evening each fortnight to calculate the
payroll. Nowadays that lack of availability from even the university&#8217;s software systems would be completely
unacceptable. The change in expectations has forced developers to adapt by designing architectures capable of
supporting this heightened up-time.
</p><!--l. 181--><p class="indent" >   In addition to shifting expectations, developers now have access to a range of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
platforms. IaaS empowers developers to quickly and programmatically create and manage computing,
networking, and storage resources. In part, this enables individual developers to support up-times comparable to
tech giants. Of course, to be able to support these up-times software has increased in overall complexity. A
website is now commonly spread over multiple servers, marking a change from centralised systems to distributed
systems.
