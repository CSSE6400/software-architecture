<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >Understanding software is hard. It is often claimed that reading code is harder than writing
code<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1001f1"></a>.
This principle is used to explain a programmer&#8217;s innate desire to constantly rewrite their code from scratch. If
software is hard to understand, then understanding software architecture from the detail of the code is
near impossible. Fortunately, architects have developed a number of techniques to manage this
complexity.
</p><!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >   A software architecture consists of many dimensions. Programming languages, communication protocols, the
operating systems and hardware used, virtualisation used, and the code itself are a subset of the many dimensions
which comprise a software architecture. Asking a programmer&#8217;s monkey brain to understand, communicate,
or document every dimension at once is needlessly cruel. This is where architectural views come
in.
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   Architectural views, or architectural projections, are a representation of one or more related aspects of a
software architecture. Views allow us to focus on a particular slice of our multi-dimensional software architecture,
ignoring other irrelevant slices. For example, if we are interested in applying a security patch to our software then
we are only interested in the view which tells us which software packages are used on each host
machine.
</p><!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >   The successful implementation of any architecture relies on the ability for the architectural views to be
disseminated, understood, and implemented. For some organisations, the software is simple enough, or the team
small enough, that the design can be communicated through word of mouth. As software becomes increasingly
complex and developers number in the thousands, it is critical for design to be communicated as effectively as
possible. In addition to facilitating communication, architectural views also enable architectural policies to be
designed and implemented.

<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >Simon Brown&#8217;s C4 model provides a set of abstractions that describe the static structure of the software
architecture <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xbrown2022c4">3</a>]</span>. The C4 model uses these abstractions in a hierarchical set of diagrams, each leading to finer levels
of detail. The hierarchical structure is based on the idea that a software system is composed of containers, which
are implemented by components, that are built using code.

<!--l. 81--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1-x-x-120">Architecturally significant requirements </span>(ASR) are functional or non-functional requirements, or constraints or
principles, which influence the design of the system architecture. The structure of a software architecture has to be
designed to ensure that the ASRs can be delivered.
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    
</p><!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" >Not all requirements for a system will be architecturally significant, but those that are need to be identified. Once
ASRs are identified, an architecture needs to be designed to deliver them. This may require some
research, and experimentation with prototypes, to determine which options are appropriate. Tests
should be designed to verify that the architecture is delivering the ASRs. Ideally, these should be part
of an automated test suite. This may not be possible for all tests. Regardless, the ASR tests should
be executed frequently during development to provide assurance that the system will deliver the
ASRs.
</p><!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   Inevitably, some ASRs will be discovered later in the project. The existing architecture will need to be evaluated
to determine if it can deliver the new ASRs. If it can, new tests need to be added to the ASR test suite to verify
delivery of the new ASRs. If the architecture is no longer suitable due to the new ASRs, a major redesign needs to
be done to create a new, more suitable, architecture.

be included in component diagrams. For example, a logging component is an important part of many software
systems. But, due to the nature of a logging component, most other components will use it. Adding it to
component diagrams will usually clutter the diagrams without adding much useful information. Usually it is better
to add a note indicating which logging component is used in the system. If it is helpful to indicate which
components use the logging component, it may be better to colour code these components or use an icon to
represent that they use the logging component.

class="Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1-x-x-120">class </span>is one type of classifier. In a class diagram, a rectangle
represents a class, unless a keyword is used to indicate that it is a different type of classifier. Classifier rectangles
have three compartments. The top compartment contains its name and optionally includes a keyword,
stereotypes and properties for the classifier. The middle compartment contains <span 
class="Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1-x-x-120">attributes</span>. The bottom
compartment contains <span

class="Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1-x-x-120">associations</span>, which may optionally have an arrow indicating the direction of the
relationship. An association indicates a structural relationship between classes. Typically this means that the target
of an association will be an implicit attribute of the class. The end of an association can use <span

the number of objects of the class that may take part in the relationship.

<span

<!--l. 526--><p class="noindent" >In section <a 
href="#x1-40003.1">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:storeReq --></a>, four ASRs were identified for the Sahara eCommerce system. These were the abililty to continue
shopping on different devices, scalability, robustness and availability.
</p><!--l. 529--><p class="indent" >   Implementing shared logic on an application server, as shown in figure <a 
href="#x1-12003r13">13<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:c4_deployment --></a>, enables the web and mobile
applications to share common logic and state. This delivers the functionality of allowing a customer to start
shopping on one device and to continue on another device. It also minimises duplication of logic, as it is shared by
the frontend applications.
</p><!--l. 534--><p class="indent" >   Using separate computing infrastructure for the web server, application server, application database, and
data mining service, as shown in figure <a 
href="#x1-12003r13">13<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:c4_deployment --></a>, provides more options to deliver scalability, robustness
and availability. For scalability and performance, each computing environment can be optimised
for the services it delivers. It also means that new infrastructure can be deployed to target specific
bottlenecks.
</p><!--l. 539--><p class="noindent" >The  system  follows  the  <a 
href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/stateful-vs-stateless" ><span 
class="Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1-x-x-120">stateless  architecture</span>
pattern</a><span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn17x0" id="fn17x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">17</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-13001f17"></a>.
The web and mobile applications do not store any application state (e.g. products currently stored in the shopping
cart). Every time the customer performs a transaction (e.g. viewing product details or adding a product
to their shopping cart), the web or mobile application sends a message to the application server
to perform the action. The application server then saves or loads data to or from the application
database.
</p><!--l. 546--><p class="indent" >   This means that web and mobile applications can send messages to a different application server for each
request. This facilitates scalability, robustness and availability. A new application server can be started to cater for
increasing system load, or to replace a failed server. The stateless nature of the application server logic means that
no data will be lost if a server fails, or if a frontend application accesses a different application server in the middle
of a customer&#8217;s shopping experience.
</p><!--l. 552--><p class="indent" >   Having multiple application servers, web servers, and multiple application databases, means that if one server
fails its load can be picked up by other servers. Automating the process of starting or restarting servers improves
robustness and availability. Running the data mining service on Oracle&#8217;s cloud infrastructure means
that we can rely on their management of services to guarantee our required level of scalability and
availability.
</p><!--l. 558--><p class="indent" >   One challenge of a stateless architecture is providing a replicated database that contains up-to-date copies of
the system&#8217;s state. We will look at this issue later in the course.
</p><!--l. 561--><p class="indent" >   By designing the architecture as a set of components running on different servers, it is also easier to migrate
the application to cloud-based infrastructure. Figure <a 
href="#x1-12003r13">13<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:c4_deployment --></a> does not constrain the system to run on physical hardware
hosted by Sahara eCommerce. Any of the nodes could be provisioned by a service offered by a cloud
provider.

 id="x1-140004"></a>Tools</h3>
<!--l. 567--><p class="noindent" >We will use C4 as our standard notation in this course, supplemented with UML diagrams when
their level of detail is appropriate. C4 is popular because it has a basic structure, but the rules are
intentionally loose to make it easy to adopt. You should use tools to aid the creation of your diagrams and
documentation.
</p><!--l. 572--><p class="indent" >   The important thing is that you should use a modelling tool, not a drawing tool. A few drawing tools provide C4
templates. The issue with drawing tools is that they do not know what the elements of the diagram mean. If a
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    
container name is changed in a drawing tool, you will need to manually change it wherever it is referenced
in other diagrams. A modelling tool will track the information that describes the model, so that a
change to a model element in one place, will be replicated wherever that element appears in other
diagrams.

</p><!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   Despite preferences, there are situations where there are advantages of using a text-based modelling tool.
Being text, the model can be stored and versioned in a version control system (e.g. git). For team projects, it is

also possible to build a tool pipeline that will generate diagrams and embed them into the project

<!--l. 593--><p class="noindent" >Module views are composed of modules, which are static units of functionality such as classes, functions,
packages, or whole programs. The defining characteristic of a module is that it represents software responsible for
some well-defined functionality. For example, a class which converts JSON to XML would be considered a
module, as would a function which performs the same task.
</p><!--l. 597--><p class="indent" >   The primary function of module views is to communicate the dependencies of a module. Rarely does software
work completely in isolation, often it is constructed with implicit or explicit dependencies. A module which
converts JSON to XML might depend upon a module which parses JSON and a module which can format XML.
Module views make these dependencies explicit.
</p><!--l. 602--><p class="indent" >   Module views focus on the developer&#8217;s perspective of how the software is implemented, rather than how it
manifests itself when deployed in a computing environment.

<!--l. 646--><p class="noindent" >Component-and-connector views focus on the structures that deliver the runtime, or dynamic behaviour of a
system. Components are units which perform some computation or operation at runtime. These components
could overlap with the modules of a module view but are often at a higher level of abstraction. The focus of
component-and-connector views is how these components communicate at runtime. Runtime communication is
the connector of components. For example, a service which registers users to a website might have new
registrations communicated via a REST request. The service may then communicate the new user information to
a database via SQL queries.
</p><!--l. 654--><p class="indent" >   When we look at software architecture, component-and-connector views are the most commonly used views.
They are common because they contain runtime information which is not easily automatically extracted. Module
views can be generated after the fact, i.e. it is easy enough for a project to generate a UML class diagram. (Simple
tools will create an unreadably complex class diagram. Tagging important information in the source code, or
manually removing small details is required to end up with readable diagrams.) Component-and-connector views
are often maintained manually by architects and developers.

They include concepts such as who is developing which software elements, where are source files stored for
different activities such as development and testing, and where are software elements executed. The first two
points are important for project management and build management. The last point of how the software is
executed on different processing nodes is important for architectural design. This is sometimes called the
<tspan font-family="\Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1" font-size="\">deployment structure </tspan>or the software system&#8217;s <tspan font-family="\Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1" font-size="\">physical architecture</tspan>.

on which the software is executed) is important when designing the software&#8217;s <tspan font-family="\Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1" font-size="\">logical architecture</tspan>.
Component-and-connector views describe the software&#8217;s logical architecture. This design of the logical
architecture must contain components that can be allocated appropriately to processing nodes, and these nodes
must have communication links that enable the components to interact.

airspaces in the world. The project&#8217;s architecture was designed by a team of three people led by Philippe.
Development was done by a team of 2500 developers from two large consulting companies. The

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7    </span> <a 
 id="x1-220007"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<!--l. 710--><p class="noindent" >Architectural views help developers understand different dimensions and details of a complex software
architecture. They are useful both during design and as documentation. During design, views help you to focus on
a particular aspect of the software architecture and ensure that it will allow the system to deliver all of its
requirements. As documentation, views help developers to understand how different aspects of the architecture
are intended to behave.
</p><!--l. 715--><p class="indent" >   We have intentionally looked at a few different approaches to helping you describe a software architecture.
You should be conversant with multiple different approaches. The hallmark of a professional is to know when to
select a particular approach.
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    
</p><!--l. 719--><p class="indent" >   If you compare the &#8220;4+1 View Model&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#X4+1-model">5</a>]</span> with the views described in <tspan font-family="\Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1" font-size="\">Software Architecture in Practice </tspan>(SAP) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xbass2021software">4</a>]</span>,
you will see that there are obvious similarities but also some differences. The logical, development and process
views from the 4+1 view model map closely to the module and component-and-connector (C&amp;C) views from
SAP. The physical view corresponds to the allocation view. The 4+1 view model also includes the scenario view,
which does not correspond directly to the SAP views.
</p><!--l. 725--><p class="indent" >   The scenario view is used to demonstrate how the architecture described in the other views delivers the core
functional requirements. It is used while designing a software architecture to validate that it is suitable for the
system.
</p><!--l. 728--><p class="indent" >   Kruchten intentionally separated the process view from the logical and development views, rather than
bundling them together like the C&amp;C view in SAP. This is because for some systems the dynamic details, which are
described by the process view, can be complex and important. Dealing with issues such as complex concurrency,
real-time interactions or latency, can often be more easily considered by having a separate view for
them.
</p><!--l. 733--><p class="indent" >   Kruchten&#8217;s experience with Canada&#8217;s integrated, nation-wide, air traffic control system was such a case. Data
from radar systems and aircraft transponders have to be processed and reported to air traffic controllers in near
real-time. With thousands of input sources and hundreds of controller stations, understanding concurrency issues
is critical. Tracking aircraft from one control space to another means that communication latency is important.
Each control space has its own hardware and is separated from neighbouring spaces by hundreds or thousands of
kilometres.
</p><!--l. 739--><p class="indent" >   The C4 model does not explicitly include the concept of views. Like SAP, it emphasises the structure of the
software architecture, adding a hierarchical lens in its structural view. These diagrams map to the 4+1 logical and
development views and the SAP module and C&amp;C views. Its behavioural view maps to aspects of
the 4+1 process view. Its infrastructure view maps to the 4+1 physical view and the SAP allocation
