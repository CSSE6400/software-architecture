<!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >As developers, we often find ourselves relying on some magical tools and technologies. Version control, operating
systems, databases, and containers, to name a few. Containers, and specifically, Docker, are magical tools which
have gained wide-spread industry adoption. Over the past decade Docker has enabled some fanciful architectures
and developer workflows. Docker is the proposed solution to the age-old programmer proverb, &#8220;it works on my
machine!&#8221;. However, before we subscribe to that belief, let&#8217;s see how Docker actually works to learn what it is, and
what it is not.

Pitched to deliver the isolation benefits of Virtual Machines (VMs) while maintaining efficient execution. Virtual machines
themselves are a much older invention, dating back to the 1960s, around the time that UQ was having it&#8217;s first computer
installed.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

The concept of a virtual machine, unlike its implementation, is straight-forward &#8212; use software to simulate
hardware. From there, one can install an operating system on the simulated hardware and start using a completely
isolated, completely new computer without any additional hardware. Of course, this process puts great strain on
the real hardware and as such, VMs are deployed sparingly.

<!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >   Unlike virtual machines, containers do not run on virtual hardware, instead, containers run on the operating
system of the host machine. The obvious advantage of this is containers run much more efficiently than virtual
machines. Containers however, manage to remain isolated and it is at this point that we should explain how
Docker actually works. Docker is built upon two individually fascinating technologies; namespaces, and layered
filesystems.
   
</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30002.1"></a>Namespaces</h4>
<!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >The first technology, namespaces, is built into the Linux kernel. Linux namespaces were
first introduced into the kernel in 2002, inspired by the concept introduced by the <a 
href="https://p9f.org/" >Plan
9</a><span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn3x0" id="fn3x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-3001f3"></a> operating
system from Bell Labs in the 1980s. Namespaces enable the partitioning and thus, isolation, of various concepts
managed and maintained by an operating system. Initially namespaces were implemented to allow isolated filesystems
(the so-called &#8216;mount&#8217; namespace). Eventually, as namespaces were expanded to include process isolation, network
isolation, and user isolation, the ability to mimic an entirely new isolated machine was realised; containers were
born.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn4x0" id="fn4x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-3003f4"></a>
</p><!--l. 108--><p class="indent" >   Namespaces provide a mechanism to create an isolated environment within your current operating system.
The creation of such an isolated environment with namespaces has been made quite easy &#8212; you can create
an isolated namespace with just a series of bash commands. Niklas Dzösch&#8217;s talk &#8216;Docker without
Docker&#8217;, uses just 84 lines of Go code (which Docker itself is written in), to create, well, Docker without
Docker.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn5x0" id="fn5x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">5</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-3005f5"></a>
But namespaces are just the first technology which enables Docker. How do you pre-populate these isolated
environments with everything you need to run a program? To see what is in the isolated environment, we would
run <span 
class="ectt-1200">ls </span>which, oh, requires the <span 
class="ectt-1200">ls </span>binary. Furthermore, to even consider running a command we need a shell to
type it in, so, oh, we should also have a <span 
class="ectt-1200">bash </span>binary. And so on until, oh, finally, we have a Linux kernel at
least!<span class="footnote-mark"><a

</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-40002.2"></a>Layered Filesystem</h4>
<!--l. 120--><p class="noindent" >A core principle of Unix operating systems is that everything is a file. Naturally then, if we want to start using an
isolated environment, all we need to do is copy in all the files which together form an operating system, right?
Well, yes, kind of. In principle this is all you need do but this would hardly enable the popularity Docker enjoys
today.
</p><!--l. 126--><p class="indent" >   Say that you want to send your coworker a Docker container which has nginx (a tool for routing web traffic)
setup in just the way you need to pass incoming traffic to various components of your application. Let&#8217;s assume
that you have setup nginx in Ubuntu. All you would need to do is zip up all the files which compose the Ubuntu
operating system (an impressively small 188MB), then all the files installed by nginx (about 55MB) and finally all
the configuration files which you have modified, somewhere in the order of 1000 bytes or 1 KB. In total you
are sending your coworker about 243MBs worth of data, less than a gigabyte, so they are not too
upset.
</p><!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >   Now once we have finished developing our application and we are ready to package it up and send it to the
world. Rather than trying to support every known operating system, we bundle all our services in Docker
containers, one for nginx, one for mysql, one for our web application, etc, etc. If your application&#8217;s containers are
as popular as nginx, this means one <span 
class="Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1-x-x-120">billion </span>downloads of your container. At a size of 243MBs, you
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    
have contributed 243 <span 
class="Cabin-Italic-tlf-t1-x-x-120">petabytes </span>to the world&#8217;s collective bandwidth usage, and that is just your nginx
container.
</p><!--l. 140--><p class="indent" >   Docker&#8217;s success over other containerisation applications comes from the way it avoids this looming data
disaster. A concept known as the layered, or overlayed, or the stacked filesystem solves the problem. First
proposed in the early 1990s, layered filesystems enable layers of immutable files to be stacked below a top-level
writable system. This has the effect of producing a seemingly mutable (or writable) filesystem while never actually
modifying the collection of immutable files. Whenever a immutable file is &#8216;written to&#8217;, a copy of the file is made
and all modifications are written to this file. When reading or listing files, the filesystem overlays the layers of
immutable files together with the layer of mutable files. This gives the appearance of one homogeneous
filesystem.

<!--l. 191--><p class="indent" >   Docker uses this technique to reduce the amount of duplicated files. If you have Docker containers
which run nginx, MySQL, and Python but all containers run on Ubuntu, then your computer will only
need to store one copy of the Ubuntu filesystem. Each container will store the changes to the base
operating system required to install each application and project that layer over the immutable Ubuntu
filesystem.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-50002.3"></a>Summary</h4>
<!--l. 197--><p class="noindent" >While Docker itself only came out in 2013, the two primary technologies which it is composed of, namespaces
and the layered filesystem, were around since the early 1990s. Docker combines these technologies to enable
applications to run in an isolated environment which can be efficiently replicated across different
host computers. The reproducibility of Docker containers, and the fact that they are so light weight,
makes them an ideal target for two important aspects of modern development; developers simulating
production environments locally, and duplicating production machines to scale for large loads of
traffic.

<!--l. 205--><p class="noindent" >Now that we understand the fundamentals of how Docker works, let&#8217;s start building our
very first Docker container. To follow along, you will need to have Docker installed on your
computer<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn7x0" id="fn7x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">7</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-6001f7"></a> and have access to basic

 id="x1-6003f8"></a>
</p><!--l. 210--><p class="indent" >   To start with, we will write a <span 
class="ectt-1200">Dockerfile </span>which builds a Docker image without an operating system and just
prints &#8216;Hello World&#8217; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xdocker-from-scratch">1</a>]</span>. The Docker &#8216;code&#8217; is written in a <span 
class="ectt-1200">Dockerfile </span>which is then &#8216;compiled&#8217; into a
Docker image and finally run as a Docker container. The first command in your <span 
class="ectt-1200">Dockerfile </span>should
always be <span 
class="ectt-1200">FROM</span>. This command tells Docker what immutable filesystem we want to start from, often,
this will be your chosen operating environment. In this exercise, since we do not want an operating
system, we start with <span 
class="ectt-1200">FROM scratch</span>, a no-op instruction that tells Docker to start with an empty
filesystem.
</p><!--l. 218--><p class="indent" >   Let&#8217;s get something in this container. For this, we will use the <span 
class="ectt-1200">COPY </span>command which copies files from the host
machine (your computer) into the container. For now, we will write <span 
class="ectt-1200">COPY hello-world /</span>, which says to copy
a file from the current directory named <span 
class="ectt-1200">hello-world </span>into the root directory (<span 
class="ectt-1200">/</span>) of the container.
We do not yet have a <span 
class="ectt-1200">hello-world </span>file but we can worry about that later. Finally, we use the <span 
class="ectt-1200">CMD</span>
command to tell the container what to do when it is run. This should be the command which starts your
application.

illustrating the power of Docker isolation as well as the difficulty of not having an operating system. This

are not available in the empty Docker container. <span
