\point[Quote]{Architecture is the stuff you can't Google.\\

\point[Quote]{There are no right or wrong answers in architecture---only trade-offs.\\

\point[\Large Architectural Design]
{\vspace{0.5em}Architects use knowledge and experience to analyse trade-offs to design architectures appropriate to the system context.}

\note[itemize]{
    \item Architects need greater technical breadth than depth
    \vspace{2mm}
    \item Breadth allows better consideration of trade-offs
    \vspace{2mm}
    \item Avoid trying to become an expert across many areas\\ ~~-- You'll fail
    \vspace{2mm}
    \item Don't stop learning -- increase your breadth\\ ~~-- Don't let your knowledge become stale

\definition{Conway's Law}
{Organisations design systems whose structure is inevitably a copy of the organisation's communication structure \cite{conways-law} \cite{maccormack2012}.}
\note[itemize]{
    \item First citation is original article.
    \vspace{2mm}
    \item Second is one of several about MIT and Harvard research into the phenomenon,
          calling it the \highlight{mirroring hypothesis}.
          \begin{itemize}
          	\Large\item Compared open source to commercial packages\\ (e.g. Linux to Solaris).
          \end{itemize}
    \item Elaborate on this point and Coplien's research into organisational sociology.
    \vspace{2mm}
    \item Reasons
          \begin{itemize}
		  	  \Large\item Governance structures constrain communication paths.
		  	  \Large\item This constrains space in which to search for solutions, constraining problem solving approaches.
		  \end{itemize}
}

\point[\Large Conway's Law Consequences]{
\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Business Process Management
    \vspace{2mm}
    \item Microservices to reflect organisation structure
    \vspace{2mm}
   \item Teams formed around services
\end{itemize}
}
\note[itemize]{
    \item BPM: Redesign organisation structure to reflect system you want
    \vspace{2mm}
    \item Microservices: Design system to reflect your organisation
    \vspace{2mm}
    \item Elaborate on benefits of both approaches
    \vspace{2mm}
    \item Comment on benefits of small focused teams
}

\point[\Large Conway's Law Consequences]{\vspace{0.5em}Team insularity -- more loyal to team than organisation}
\note[itemize]{
    \item Amazon order tracking example from 2022 week 11\\ ~~-- Negotiation difficulties with other teams
    \vspace{2mm}
    \item Need to ensure inter-team cooperation
    \vspace{2mm}
    \item Possibly move people between teams
    \vspace{2mm}
    \item Microservices can encourage insularity
    \vspace{2mm}
    \item Many teams can also encourage insularity
    \vspace{2mm}
    \item Intra-team communication becomes more difficult with large teams

\begin{frame}{Conway's Law Issues}
\vspace{1pt}
{\huge
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cross-cutting concerns
    \begin{itemize}
        \LARGE\item e.g. Security
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{2mm}
    \item Organisation structure should align with market structure
    \vspace{2mm}
    \item Physical location of teams
\end{itemize}
}
\end{frame}
\note[itemize]{
    \item Cross-cutting concerns span services \& consequently teams
    \item Can't have a ``security'' service\\ ~~-- Needs to be part of \highlight{every} service
    \item Teams solely based around Conway's law and services may not deliver some cross-cutting concerns
    \item Cooperation, documentation \& audits may be necessary
    \item Market structure may complement team structure to place teams closer to their end users
    \item Global development \& outsourcing mean different teams are likely to be in different locations
    \item Requires additional overhead \& documentation for cooperation between teams

	\item Time Dimension: Written is available in the future
    \vspace{2mm}
	\item Extent of either depends on SE process
    \vspace{2mm}
	\item Extent also depends on engagement of each type of stakeholder

	\item Technical Documentation guest lecture in week 11 only touched on docs written for developers \\
