\note[enumerate]{
    \item ADRs are the `why' of the architecture.
    \item Good if obvious approach is wrong.
    \item Mechanism for preserving assumptions of an architecture.

    \item ADRs follow on from views.

\begin{frame}{Record Decisions that Influence}

\Large{
\begin{itemize}
    \item \highlight{Structure} of the architecture
    \item Delivery of \highlight{quality attributes}
    \item \highlight{Dependencies} between important parts of the architecture
	\vspace{1mm}
    \item \highlight{Interfaces} between important parts of the architecture
    \begin{itemize}
        \large{\item or external interfaces}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \highlight{Principles} about implementation techniques or platforms
\end{itemize}
}

\note{
    \begin{description}
        \item[Structure] e.g. \highlight{plugin} architecture because core platform expecting others to build or
        \highlight{microservices} architecture because of the need to scale and small teams.
        \item[Quality attributes] e.g. need to be \highlight{highly scalable} so we used cloud services.
        \item[Dependencies/Interfaces] we picked dependency Y, i.e. SMS API because rationale.
        ADRs don't record details of interface, just rationale.
        \item[Principles]
            \begin{itemize}
                \item use haskell because we get computer science grads.
                \item use on-prem because government org and have regulation.
                \item use language because of obsecure dependency.
            \end{itemize}

\note[enumerate]{
    \item Think of ADRs as warnings.
    \item Why is this not a good ADR? (No rationale.)
}

\questionanswer{Why ADRs?}
{My code will defeat the architectural design,\\
\highlight{if} I do not know why it was designed that way.}

\note[enumerate]{
    \item I will break things if I don't know why it works a certain way.
    \item I'll just \textsl{fix that}.
}

\point[ADRs]{Record a \highlight{single} decision}

\note[enumerate]{
	\item Keeps it short.
	\item More likely to write it (and read it).
}

\point[ADRs]{Are \highlight{never} deleted\\
Mark as \highlight{superseded} and link to new decision}

\note[enumerate]{
	\item Preserves bad decisions --- less likely to repeat them.
	\item Superseded decision:
	\item 1) that was a bad idea;
	\item 2) that was a good idea at the time but certain conditions have changed.
}

\questionanswer{Where are ADRs documented?}
{Each decision is a separate file in the project repository\footnote{See the \texttt{adrs} directory
in the \href{https://csse6400.uqcloud.net/resources/c4_model.zip}{C4 Model} on the course website.}}

\note{
C4 allows you to link to ADRs.

Useful to note as ADRs will be required for the project.

\begin{frame}{ADR Template \cite{nygard-adr}}

\Large{
\begin{description}
    \item[Title] Short phrase describing the decision
    \item[Date] When the decision was made
    \item[Status] Current status of the decision
    \begin{itemize}
        \large{\item proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded, rejected}
    \end{itemize}
    \item[Summary] Summarise the decision and its rationale
    \item[Context] Describe the facts that influence the decision
    \item[Decision] Explain how the decision will solve the problem
    \item[Consequences] Impact of the decision
    \begin{itemize}
        \large{\item what's easier to do}
        \large{\item what's harder to do}
    \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\end{frame}

\note{
    \begin{description}
        \item[Title] Descriptive, easy to find, part of the filename.
        \item[Status] Rejected is an option --- prevents repeating proposals.
        \item[Summary] Describe context.
    \end{description}

\note{
    From Sahara example in the views lecture/notes.

    Sahara functional requirement: Ability to change mode of interaction with the system.

    Independent business logic enables this.

    Format of the summary is a why statement --- summarise the context and decision.
